Football stats on the top leagues, teams and players in Europe for the 2021-22 season 


During January 2021, I committed myself to learning R for the first time by building the prototype of the football app using the `rshiny` package (and other modules to assist with the MVP). 

I learnt quite a few things during this time including:

- REST APIs
- R (the language, core concepts, real-world use cases)



### Here are the modules used to bring this app to life:

- Pandas
- Requests
- Os
- CSV


## Data Sources

`RapidAPI` is the main source for our football statistics, which would be divided into:
- League
- Teams
- Players



## Plan of Action 
It is always important to establish the steps you need to take in your projects, so here are the stages we need to successfully implement this app:

- Design a wireframe ofthe football app including the stats you want to visualize as graphs and charts
- Visualize them in Jupyter Lab/Notebook
- Wrap a Dash app around the graphs and charts 
- Deploy to Heroku 
- Document each stage of the app (from concept to deployment)


## Statistics & Visuals

The app contains the following stats:

- League Standings 
- Top Scorers
- Top Assists
- Most/Least Goals Scored by Team
- Most/Least Goals Conceded by Team
- Most/Least Shots (on Target) by Team
- Most/Least Passes Completed 
- Most/Least Clean Sheets
- Best/Worst Defensive team
