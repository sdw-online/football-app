# football-app
Football stats on the top leagues, teams and players in Europe for the 2021-22 season 


The prototype of this app was built in R using the Rshiny package. This took around a month to build when I was learning about R (January 2021). 

I learnt quite a few things during this time including:

- REST APIs
- R (the language, core concepts, real-world use cases)



### Here are the modules used to bring this app to life:

- Pandas
- Requests
- Os
- CSV
