# football-app
Football stats on the top leagues, teams and players in Europe for the 2021-22 season 


The prototype of this app was built in R using the Rshiny package. This took around a month to build when I was learning about R (January 2021). 

I learnt quite a few things during this time including:

- REST APIs
- R (the language, core concepts, real-world use cases)



### Here are the modules used to bring this app to life:

- Pandas
- Requests
- Os
- CSV


## Data Sources

`RapidAPI` is the main source for our football statistics, which would be divided into:
- League
- Teams
- Players



## Plan of Action 

- Design a wireframe ofthe football app including the stats you want to visualize as graphs and charts
- Visualize them in Jupyter Lab/Notebook
- Wrap a Dash app around the graphs and charts 
- Deploy to Heroku 
- Document each stage of the app (from concept to deployment)


## Statistics & Visuals

The app contains the following stats:

- League Standings 
- Top Scorers
- Top Assists
- Most/Least Goals Scored by Team
- Most/Least Goals Conceded by Team
